Invented to frighten evil spirits rather than fuel guns or bombs—neither of which had been thought of yet—their simple mixture of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal went on to make the modern world possible. As word of its explosive properties spread from Asia to Europe, from pyrotechnics to battleships, it paved the way for Western exploration, hastened the end of feudalism and the rise of the nation state, and greased the wheels of the Industrial Revolution.With dramatic immediacy, novelist and journalist Jack Kelly conveys both the distant time in which the “devil's distillate” rose to conquer the world, and brings to rousing life the eclectic cast of characters who played a role in its epic story, including Michelangelo, Edward III, Vasco da Gama, Cortés, Guy Fawkes, Alfred Nobel, and E. I. DuPont. A must-read for history fans and military buffs alike, Gunpowder brings together a rich terrain of cultures and technological innovations with authoritative research and swashbuckling style.","author":"Jack Kelly","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G6sstAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","googleid":"G6sstAEACAAJ","selflink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/G6sstAEACAAJ","readers":[{"rid":"638b450e7952a600115a6fa7","added":"4:51:40 AM","shelf":"undefined","rating":"2","is_fave":"","review":"no reason to read this book. it isn't that great.","_id":{"$oid":"638b465c7952a600115a6fba"}}],"creator":{"$oid":"638b450e7952a600115a6fa7"},"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum, on sale September 5th, 2011. A New Edition of the Phenomenal #1 Bestseller \"One mark of a great book is that it makes you see things in a new way, and Mr. Friedman certainly succeeds in that goal,\" the Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz wrote in The New York Times reviewing The World Is Flat in 2005. In this new edition, Thomas L. Friedman includes fresh stories and insights to help us understand the flattening of the world. Weaving new information into his overall thesis, and answering the questions he has been most frequently asked by parents across the country, this third edition also includes two new chapters--on how to be a political activist and social entrepreneur in a flat world; and on the more troubling question of how to manage our reputations and privacy in a world where we are all becoming publishers and public figures. The World Is Flat 3.0 is an essential update on globalization, its opportunities for individual empowerment, its achievements at lifting millions out of poverty, and its drawbacks--environmental, social, and political, powerfully illuminated by the Pulitzer Prize--winning author of The Lexus and the Olive Tree.","author":"Thomas L.
